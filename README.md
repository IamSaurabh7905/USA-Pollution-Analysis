# USA-Pollution-Analysis
During my 'US Pollution Analysis' project, I used Power BI to create a dashboard that analyzed pollutants across cities.
The dashboard provided insights into the top contributors to pollution and trends over time.
One challenge was ensuring the data from multiple sources was consistent.
I solved this by writing scripts in Python to clean and preprocess the data before importing it into Power BI.
